# Trail Mix
As a cyclist, I want to find a good place to eat at the end of my trail ride. Trail Mix allows a user to search for cycling trails within any given city or zip code. The application will return a list of the five nearest cycling trails to the searched area.

Once the list has been returned, the user can click on any of the trails of their choice, and a div will appear underneath the selected trail displaying the four restaurants that are closest to the end of the trail. It will also display the the distance from the end of the trail to the restaurant.

The page can be refreshed to perform any number of searches.
